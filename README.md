# Looking_for_a_team_please_read
Since I am 15 years old I explore a very specific spot of philosophy and I scare the shit out of people with it but I cant help it and people could not care less. So now I am looking for a team here. Maybe there are people on github who are looking to find a team like this and to we can become a team together.

Please have a look at my thesis about communication: https://www.thalia.de/shop/home/artikeldetails/A1072272105
And then you can decide if you would like to become a team with me.
Since I am able to recognize thoughts that can be broken or are about to be broken, I would like to program something to prevent thoughts from being broken.
I believe thoghts can be broken like bones and then people run around in the world with broken thoughts and nobody can see it because they are hidden in the body and people taught
each other not to scream then but then I believe that people die partwise while being alive and this is what scares me the most about my project and I want to write code about this.

Also I tried many different ways to cure my thoughts when they were broken and looked up many areas of possibilities and I do not like the outcome that is represented by now so I
want to try something new.

So my latest idea about broken thoughts is that it would be a good idea if people could find a little rest in a coffin to put their thoughts to the ground. Do you understand?
It´s like when people want to die and they wish for a grave, then you give them a pretty coffin with nice coushions and a cozy pet or so and then you let them speak. I believe this is just a great idea and it is very new and I shared it already with two people but they said it would be absurd and I am kind of shocked that nobody likes my idea.

Now I want to find someone you wants to join my idea and pay so that I can fullfill this idea to find a new solution for people who may be very sad and especially so sad that they may wish to die. So this serious but I want to give them something because what do get by now?

They just can call at hotlines and then there are people to talk too, ok.
They can go to the hospital and look for medical advice and medication, ok.
They can go to therapy and do the therapy, ok.
They can get an application to do the therapy online, ok.

Well this is nothing. 

Seriously, this is nothing. It is just a little drop of water while the whole world is burning.

Why? And my idea is absurd?

I think you are nuts and I want someone to pay for my idea so I can realize it.

Who is going to show me some interest?
