# Looking_for_a_team_please_read
Since I am 15 years old I explore a very specific spot of philosophy and I scare the shit out of people with it but I cant help it and people could not care less. So now I am looking for a team here. Maybe there are people on github who are looking to find a team like this and to we can become a team together.

Please have a look at my thesis about communication: https://www.thalia.de/shop/home/artikeldetails/A1072272105
And then you can decide if you would like to become a team with me.
Since I am able to recognize thoughts that can be broken or are about to be broken, I would like to program something to prevent thoughts from being broken.
I believe thoghts can be broken like bones and then people run around in the world with broken thoughts and nobody can see it because they are hidden in the body and people taught
each other not to scream then but then I believe that people die partwise while being alive and this is what scares me the most about my project and I want to write code about this.

Also I tried many different ways to cure my thoughts when they were broken and looked up many areas of possibilities and I do not like the outcome that is represented by now so I
want to try something new.
